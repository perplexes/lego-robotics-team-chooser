# Robotics Team Formation Guide

Welcome! This guide explains how our system creates balanced and effective robotics teams. We've designed it to consider many factors - from student preferences to team dynamics - to help create great team experiences for everyone involved.

## How Teams Are Formed

### Special Teams
We start with two special teams that have specific purposes:
* **The All-Girls Team (Team 0)**
* **The 8th Grade Team (Team 1)**: When running in "separate mode", we group 8th graders together.

### Regular Teams
After forming special teams, we create regular teams with these guidelines:
* Teams need 4-8 students to ensure they're not too small or too large
* We try to keep team sizes as even as possible
* When we include students from a grade (6th or 7th), we make sure there are at least 2 students from that grade - this helps prevent any student from feeling isolated
* In "distributed mode", we spread 8th graders across teams (maximum one per team) so they can help mentor younger students

## Team Roles

As specified by FIRST:
* Team Captain
* Innovation Project Leader
* Mission Strategist
* Public Relations Lead
* LEGO Lead Builder
* Lead Coder

### How Roles Are Assigned
We try to match students with roles they're excited about while keeping teams balanced:

* Each team needs all six roles filled - no missing roles!
* Students can have 0-2 roles, but we prefer giving each student exactly one role
* We look at students' preferences (rated 1-3) when matching roles
* If some students only used two numbers in their preferences (like only 1s and 2s), we adjust their scores to use the full range:
  - If they used 1s and 2s: We treat their 2s as 3s (since that was their highest preference)
  - If they used 2s and 3s: We treat their 2s as 1s (since that was their lowest preference)

### Role Assignment Scoring
We use a point system to create fair role assignments:

For most students:
* Best case: +30 points for having exactly one role
* Okay case: -20 points for having two roles
* Least preferred: -50 points for having no roles

For 6th graders (we're a bit stricter to ensure they have a good experience):
* Best case: +50 points for having exactly one role
* Okay case: -80 points for having two roles
* Least preferred: -100 points for having no roles

We also try to avoid conflicts where multiple students who really wanted a particular role (rated it a 3) end up on the same team, as this could lead to disappointment.

## The Big Picture

The system balances all these factors to create teams that:
* Give students roles they're interested in
* Keep teams balanced in size and grade distribution
* Ensure every team has all necessary roles covered
* Create supportive environments through special teams and grade grouping
* Help 6th graders have a great first-year experience
